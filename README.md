## Setup the project!
1. Delete all the files inside the **_keystores_** folder.
2. Create a new key:
```bash
keytool -genkeypair -alias ecikeypair -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -storetype PKCS12 -keystore ecikeystore.p12 -validity 3650
```
3. Add a password and fill the gaps as follows:

<br />

4. Save the certificate:
```bash
keytool -export -keystore ./ecikeystore.p12 -alias ecikeypair -file ecicert.cer
```
5. Add a trusted store using the certifiactes
```bash
keytool -import -file ./ecicert.cer -alias firstCA -keystore myTrustStore
```

## Run the project locally:
---
1. Clone the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/juancho20sp/AREP-SecureApp
```
2. Compile the project:
```bash
mvn clean install
```
3. Run the HelloService app:
- For Windows:
```bash
java -cp "target/classes;target/dependency/*" edu.escuelaing.arep.HelloServer
```
- For Unix systems:
```bash
java -cp "target/classes:target/dependency/*" edu.escuelaing.arep.HelloServer
```
4. Run the main app:
- For Windows:
```bash
java -cp "target/classes;target/dependency/*" edu.escuelaing.arep.App
```
- For Unix systems:
```bash
java -cp "target/classes:target/dependency/*" edu.escuelaing.arep.App
```

## Run the project in AWS:
---
1. Create two EC2 instances.
2. Clone the project on each EC2 instance:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/juancho20sp/AREP-SecureApp
```
3. Run the HelloService app:
```bash
java -cp "target/classes:target/dependency/*" edu.escuelaing.arep.HelloServer
```
4. Run the main app:
```bash
java -cp "target/classes:target/dependency/*" edu.escuelaing.arep.App
```
5. Config the security groups of each instance in order to open the ports required by the system.
